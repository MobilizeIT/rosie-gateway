# Rosie Gateway - Brain of the Smarter Home

Rosie is a free and open source platform for smart home automation. Our goal with Rosie is to create an open, extensible smarter 
home controller for the homes of now and the future. No proprietary hardware and no DRM. 

The Rosie System is organized around central hub or gateway, a repository and a network of connected sensors. [See this document](/docs/architecture.md) for more information about the architecture of the Rosie system.
